- [x] Complete migration from canvas-based to Phaser.js WebGL rendering
- [x] Professional map editor with modern game engine foundation
- [x] Dynamic hex grid system covering entire visible camera area
- [x] Accurate coordinate conversion matching Go backend (`lib/map.go`) exactly
- [x] Interactive controls: mouse wheel zoom, drag pan, keyboard navigation

### Coordinate System Accuracy âœ…
- [x] Fixed coordinate conversion to match backend implementation exactly
- [x] `tileWidth=64, tileHeight=64, yIncrement=48` matching `lib/map.go`
- [x] Row/col conversion using odd-row offset layout from `lib/hex_coords.go`
- [x] Pixel-perfect click-to-hex coordinate mapping
- [x] Eliminated coordinate drift between frontend and backend

### Professional Mouse Interaction âœ…
