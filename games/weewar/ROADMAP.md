## âœ… Phase 4: Coordinate System Migration (Completed)
**Status**: 95% Complete  
**Timeline**: January 2025

### Core System Refactoring âœ…
- [x] Migrated from row/col to cube coordinates (Q/R/S system)
- [x] Implemented proper hex-to-pixel conversion using Red Blob Games formulas
- [x] Fixed odd-r layout as standard (eliminates configuration complexity)
- [x] Added proper hex distance calculations with `CubeDistance()`
- [x] Updated core data structures (Unit, Tile) to use cube coordinates

### API Migration âœ…
- [x] `TileAt()` now uses cube coordinates as primary method
- [x] `IsValidMove()` and `GetMovementCost()` use cube coordinates
- [x] `MoveUnit()` and `CanMoveUnit()` use cube coordinates
- [x] Removed wrapper methods to enforce cube coordinate usage

### Architecture Improvements âœ…
- [x] Implemented proper Game-World-Observer architecture separation
- [x] Game object focuses on flow control and game logic
- [x] World object contains pure state (Map, Units organized by player)
- [x] Removed all rendering methods from Game object
- [x] Updated WorldRenderer to work directly with World data using cube coordinates
- [x] Map includes OriginX/OriginY for coordinate system origin management

### CLI Translation Layer âœ…
- [x] CLI preserves chess notation (A1, B2) for user experience
- [x] Internal conversion: Chess notation â†’ cube coordinates
- [x] Centralized validation logic in Game object
- [x] CLI acts as thin translation layer

### Remaining Work ðŸš§
- [ ] Update editor.go to use cube coordinates
- [ ] Update all test files to use cube coordinate APIs
- [ ] Add World state change notifications

### Latest Progress âœ…
- [x] Implemented complete dynamic map resizing API with normalized coordinates
- [x] Added AddLeftCols(n)/RemoveLeftCols(n) methods with proper origin adjustment
- [x] Added AddTopRows(n)/RemoveTopRows(n) methods with hex geometry spacing
- [x] Added AddRightCols(n)/RemoveRightCols(n) and AddBottomRows(n)/RemoveBottomRows(n) methods
- [x] Origin coordinates now use normalized tile width units for consistency
- [x] Comprehensive bounds validation for all removal operations

### Canvas Rendering Completed âœ…
- [x] Updated CanvasRenderer to work directly with World data using cube coordinates
- [x] Eliminated CreateGameForRendering approach in WASM canvas rendering
- [x] Canvas rendering now follows identical patterns to BufferRenderer
- [x] Both PNG and Canvas rendering systems unified under clean architecture

### Benefits Achieved âœ…
- **Mathematical correctness**: Proper hex distance calculations
- **Code simplification**: Eliminated hardcoded tile dimensions
- **User experience**: CLI chess notation preserved (A1, B2)
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for coordinates
- **Clean architecture**: Proper separation of concerns between Game, World, and Rendering
