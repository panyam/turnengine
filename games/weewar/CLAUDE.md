## Understand the Project First
- This is a project for building a template for webapps.  Go through the README and the various .md files to understand the project and the motivation and where we are.

## Coding Style and Conservativeness

- Be conservative on how many comments are you are adding or modifying unless it is absolutely necessary (for example a comment could be contradicting what is going on - in which case it is prudent to modify it).  
- When modifying files just focus on areas where the change is required instead of diving into a full fledged refactor.
- Make sure you ignore 'gen' and 'node_modules' as it has a lot of files you wont need for most things and are either auto generated or just package dependencies
- When updating .md files and in commit messages use emojis and flowerly languages sparingly.  We dont want to be too grandios or overpromising.
- Make sure the playwright tool is setup so you can inspect the browser when we are implementing and testing the Dashboard features.
- Do not refer to claude or anthropic or gemini in your commit messages
- Do not rebuild the server - it will be continuosly be rebuilt and run by the devloop.
- Find the root cause of an issue before figuring out a solution.  Fix problems.
- Do not create workarounds for issues without asking.  Always find the root cause of an issue and fix it.
- The web module automatically builds when files are changed - DO NOT run npm build or npm run build commands.
- Proto files are automatically regenerated when changed - DO NOT run buf generate commands.
- In general DONT be defensive by catching errors or null checking objects that when null would make the whole page fail anyway.    Dont just try/catch to log errors - let exceptions happen naturally so errors are NOT covered up and error locations are easier to identify.  We are still in experimenting/revising phase so we should harden as far as possible and identify failure modes rather than covering them up with try/catches (or even null checks when somethigns are really mandatory for the game to function).   Let us use preconditions more when possible.

## Continuous Builds

Builds for frontend, wasm, backend are all running continuously and can be queried using the `devloop` cli tool.   devloop is a command for watching and live reloading your projects.  It is like Air + Make on steroids.   You have the following devloop commands:
- `devloop config` - Get configuration from running devloop server
- `devloop paths` - List all file patterns being watched
- `devloop trigger <rulename>` - Trigger execution of a specific rule
- `devloop logs <rulename>`  - Stream logs from running devloop server
- `devloop status <rulename>` - Get status of rules from running devloop server

## Summary instructions

- When you are using compact, please focus on test output and code changes

- For the ROADMAP.md always use the top-level ./ROADMAP.md so we have a global view of the roadmap instead of being fragemented in various folders.

## Session Workflow Memories
- When you checkpoint update all relevant .md files with our latest understanding, statuses and progress in the current session and then commit.
