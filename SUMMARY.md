# TurnEngine Project Summary

## Project Vision
Build a local-first turn-based game engine in Go that enables rapid development of authentic strategy games. The engine follows the principle of 80% reusable framework code and 20% game-specific implementations.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Core Engine Architecture ✅
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Pure framework approach with abstract interfaces
- **Abstract Position System**: Supports multiple coordinate systems (Hex, Grid, Graph, 3D)
- **Game State Management**: Turn-based game flow with player management
- **Command Processing Pipeline**: Generic validation and execution framework
- **Board System**: Abstract board interface with pathfinding capabilities

### 2. WeeWar Implementation ✅
- **Complete Game Implementation**: Fully functional WeeWar game with authentic mechanics
- **Real Data Integration**: Extracted authentic game data from 44 units and 26 terrains
- **Map System**: 12 real maps with configurations and starting units
- **Combat System**: Probabilistic damage using real WeeWar damage matrices
- **Movement System**: Terrain-specific movement costs with A* pathfinding

### 3. Data-Driven Approach ✅
- **HTML Data Extraction**: Tools to extract real game data from web sources
- **Authentic Mechanics**: Combat and movement calculations match original WeeWar
- **Structured Data**: JSON format for units, terrains, and maps
- **Validation**: Cross-referenced extracted data for accuracy

## Technical Implementation

### Framework Components (80% Reusable)

## Key Learnings

### 1. Architecture Decisions
- **Abstract Interfaces**: Position and Board abstractions enable multiple coordinate systems
- **Component System**: Generic component registry allows pluggable game mechanics
- **Data-Driven Design**: Real game data ensures authentic gameplay mechanics
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundary between framework and game-specific code

### 2. Development Approach
- **Iterative Development**: Started with core ECS, then added game-specific systems
- **Real Data First**: Extracted authentic data before implementing game mechanics
- **Validation Through Testing**: Verified calculations match original game behavior
- **Modular Design**: Each system is independently testable and reusable

### 3. Technical Insights
- **HTML Parsing**: Go's html package effectively extracts structured data from web sources
- **Probabilistic Combat**: Real damage distributions provide authentic game feel
- **Pathfinding**: A* algorithm with terrain-specific costs enables realistic movement
- **JSON Data**: Structured data format enables easy modification and extension

## Current Status

### Completed Features
- ✅ Core ECS framework with abstract interfaces
- ✅ WeeWar combat system with real damage matrices
- ✅ Movement system with terrain-specific costs
- ✅ Map system with 12 real WeeWar maps
- ✅ Data extraction tools for units, terrains, and maps
- ✅ Game initialization and basic gameplay loop

### System Architecture
- **Framework**: 80% reusable code providing infrastructure
- **WeeWar**: 20% game-specific code with authentic mechanics
- **Data Integration**: Real game data from tinyattack.com
- **WebAssembly Ready**: Go codebase compiles to WASM for browser deployment

## Impact and Value

### 1. Reusability
- **Framework Foundation**: 80% of code is reusable for other turn-based games
- **Neptune's Pride**: Next target game can reuse most framework components
- **Rapid Development**: New games can be implemented quickly with existing infrastructure

### 2. Authenticity
- **Real Data**: Extracted from actual WeeWar game sources
- **Accurate Mechanics**: Combat and movement calculations match original game
- **Balanced Gameplay**: Maintains original game balance through authentic data

### 3. Extensibility
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easy to add new components and systems
- **Multiple Coordinate Systems**: Framework supports hex, grid, graph, and 3D boards
- **Data-Driven**: New units, terrains, and maps can be added via JSON files

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Go 1.24.0
- **Architecture**: Entity Component System (ECS)
- **Data Format**: JSON for game data
- **Web Integration**: HTML parsing for data extraction
- **Target Platform**: WebAssembly for browser deployment
